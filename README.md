# Managing-Bank-Accounts-with-Hashing

Created a Bank Account Management system in C++ using highly efficient array-based hash-maps to provide functionalities of creating and deleting accounts, adding transaction and viewing balance. Built well designed hash functions to minimize collisions and used multiple strategies for resolving collisions in hashing including Chaining, Linear Probing, Quadratic Probing and Cubic Probing.
